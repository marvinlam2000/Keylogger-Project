# Keylogger Project

## Objective
FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE ONLY! Developed a keylogging application to reseach keystroke capturing techniques, understand malware behavior, encrypting/decrypting files, and enhance detection and mitigation strategies. This project aimed to deepen my knowledge of cybersecurity threats, ethical hacking, and endpoint solutions. 

### Skills Learned

- Understanding Keylogging Techniques - Learned how keystrokes are captured
- Ethical and Legal Considerations - Ensure that I follow ethical hacking guidelines, and only test within legal boundaries
- Programming Basics - Used Python to create keylogger application
- Encrypting and Decrypting files - Encrypted and decrypted sensitive files obtained by the keylogger application and learned to clean up unnecessary files.

## Steps

1. Download Python and Pycharm to computer and import neccessary modules and libaries onto project files. (pywin32, pynput, scipy, cryptography, requests, pillow)

![step 1b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68586074-12d4-4488-b0fc-2b761ebadeb2)

2. Create a basic keylogger code and export key strokes onto a seperate text file. Modify the key strokes so that the users key strokes are easily readible in the text file.

![step 2c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8fcb25-a2fa-4848-ac26-56eab25d9e26)

3. Incorporate email functionality in the code where once the keylogger grabs the data, the text file is emailed to a personal email using a SMTP server. Ensure that the access is granted by Gmail.

![step 3b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a34ec717-0d6b-4448-8fd5-a0c74f7ecd38)

4. Writing code to getting computer information as part of the keylogger. Sending the computer information in a seperate text file.

![step 4b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986ceaf3-e59f-4746-8985-52b1bed29f97)

5. Writing code to gather audio, screenshots, clipboard, and implementing a timer on the keylogger to continously gather information.

![step 5b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fab6a68-e13f-4a02-a207-436ce47f7323)

6. Encrypt the files that were gathered from the keylogger and obfuscate the files so that the user isn't able to detect the keylogger or the encrypted files.
